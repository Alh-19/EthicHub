### Helper files

- _queries.js_
- _helpers-timestamps.js_
- _vue-store/\*_

Within the two first files you will find all queries used in info.ethichub.com and some dates/timestamps related helper functions that might be useful.

Under vue-store directory you will find two files that include "time-travel-queries" related logic. These are vue-specific files, i.e, you wont be able to use them directly in your react app.

Of course, feel free to use your own logic and use them just as a reference!

Hope they help! And keep up the good work!
